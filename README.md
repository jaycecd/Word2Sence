### 1.Preparation
- Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  

### 2.Training Word2Scene <a name="Word2Scene"></a>
- Train Word2Scene:
```
$ cd Word2Scene-main
$ python train.py --data_dir /Path/To/DATASET/
```

### 3.RS Scene Image Generation <a name="gen"></a>
- **Word2Scene:** Visualization of remote sensing scenes generated from text descriptions in the test set using different text-to-image generation methods. Zoom-in for better details.
![](images/Word2Scene.jpg)

- **Word2Scene-C:** Directly generate scenes using scene concepts from the training set. The real image is randomly selected from the images in the corresponding scene concept. Zoom-in for better details.

- **Word2Scene Zero-shot:** Directly generate scenes using scene concepts outside the training set (zero-shot). Zoom-in for better details.

- **Diversity and stability:** These samples were all randomly generated 9 times using the same description on different methods.

### 4.Interpretability of Word2Scene <a name="interpretability"></a>
- **How does textual input specifically influence the outcome of scene generation?**

    Using heatmaps to explain how text influences scene generation.
